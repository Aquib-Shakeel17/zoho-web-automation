## Zoho CRM Web Automation Framework

This is an automation framework designed for testing Zoho CRM's web application.
The framework uses **Selenium WebDriver**, **TestNG**, and **ExtentReports** for test execution,
reporting, and logging.
It follows a **Page Object Model** design and incorporates browser handling, logging, reporting, and configuration management.


**Key Components**

## Pages:
    The framework follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.
    Each page or screen in the application is represented by a corresponding Java class under the /pages folder.
    These classes contain methods that interact with the web elements on their respective pages.

## Config:
   The /config folder contains configuration-related classes such as:

    AppConfig.java: Holds static configuration values for easy access throughout the framework.
    ConfigManager.java: Loads properties from the config.properties file and provides a method to retrieve individual configuration values.

## Utilities:
   Utility classes are present under the /utils folder to assist with various tasks like:

    BrowserFactory: Initializes and manages the WebDriver.
    JsonDataReader: Handles reading and parsing data from external JSON files.
    WaitUtil: Implements wait strategies for handling dynamic web elements.
    SessionManager: Manages the browser session during tests.

## Test Classes:

   Test classes reside in the /test folder and contain the actual test cases.
   They typically extend BaseTest.java for common setup and teardown operations.
   Example test cases include:

    CreateLeadTest.java
    EditLeadTest.java
    FilterLeadTest.java
    DeleteLeadTest.java

## Test Configuration and Data:

    config.properties: Contains environment-specific settings, such as the base URL and browser configurations.
    testng.xml: Defines the test suite, which includes test execution configuration, such as which tests to run, parallel execution, etc.
    testdata.json: Stores data needed for test execution (e.g., sample input for creating a lead).

## Reports and Logs:

    ExtentReports: Provides a detailed HTML report (ExtentReport_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.html) for each test run.
    test.log: Captures logs during the execution of tests to help with debugging and tracking test progress.

## Maven (pom.xml):
   The project uses Maven as the build and dependency management tool.
   The pom.xml contains dependencies for libraries such as Selenium, TestNG, ExtentReports, and others.

## Prerequisites
    Before running the framework, ensure that the following dependencies are installed and configured:
    Create a new gmail account
    Sign up on zoho dashboard and set up account(Company name and size) -> Get started and Skip
    Verify the account from gmail account
    Sign out from zoho dashboard
    Sign in again on Zoho dashboard -> update the location
    Sign Out again
    Sign In again and -> skip (Secure your account using MFA)
    Java (JDK 11)
    Check Java installation:
    java -version
    If not installed, download from Oracle JDK or install OpenJDK.
    Apache Maven (Build Automation Tool)
    Check Maven installation:
    mvn -version
    If not installed, download from Maven and set it up in the system environment variables.
    Git (Version Control System)
    Check Git installation:
    git --version
    If not installed, download from Git.
    Chrome Browser (For Selenium WebDriver Tests)
    Ensure the latest version of Chrome is installed.
    Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/Aquib-Shakeel17/zoho-web-automation.git
    Navigate into the Project Directory: cd zoho-web-automation
    Verify the Branch: git branch -a (Check available branches) â†’ git checkout master (Switch to master branch)
    Set Up Dependencies: mvn clean install (Downloads and installs required libraries)
    Configure Properties : Update config.properties in src/test/resources for credentials (login_email, login_password) and browser settings.
    Run All Test Cases: mvn clean test (Executes the test suite).
    
## Running the Tests:

    To run the tests, execute the following Maven command:

   mvn clean test
